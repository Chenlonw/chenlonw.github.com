### Who I am
I am a Ph.D. student in geophysics in China. What I am doing is learning how to explore hydrocarbon
resource by the seismic method. My specific interests are as follows:

+ seismic wavefield simulation
+ multi-component imaging
+ velocity inversion

### About posts
+ This site is constructed for sharing some notes about programming or learning seismic theory and
marking my life.
+ My mother tongue is Chinese, however, I will try to write some of my posts in English. But it
depends.
+ Due to my limited ability, mistakes are inevitable in the posts and I am _not_ responsible for the
corresponding consequences :P
+ If you have any suggestions about the technical content or my English skills, let me know, please.
