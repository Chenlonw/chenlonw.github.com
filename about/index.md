### Who I am
My name is Chenlong Wang and I am living in Shanghai, China. I moved from a moderate city,
[Lanzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanzhou), to Shanghai in 2007 to start my bachelor degree in
Tongji university. I directly upgraded to Ph.D. student when I graduated as a bachelor in 2011.
During my Ph.D. life, what I am doing is studying how to explore hydrocarbon resource by the
seismic method. My specific interests are as follows:

+ seismic wavefield simulation
+ multi-component imaging
+ velocity inversion

More detailed information is available in my <a href="../assets/doc/chlwang-tongji.pdf"

### About posts
+ This site is constructed for sharing some notes about programming or learning seismic theory and
marking my life.
+ My mother tongue is Chinese, however, I will try to write some of my posts in English. But it
depends.
+ Due to my limited ability, mistakes are inevitable in the posts and I am _not_ responsible for the
corresponding consequences :P
+ If you have any suggestions about the technical content or my English skills, let me know, please.
