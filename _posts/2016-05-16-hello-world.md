### Hello world!

This static website is generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) software. It is freely hosted by
[Github](https://github.com).  The background photo is captured by [Vicki
Mar](https://www.flickr.com/photos/vmar/).  I really appreciate these open source softwares and
services.

My available personal information is posted in **About**. The motivation of writing this blog is
sharing some notes about programming or learning seismic theory. Meanwhile the blog is also used to
mark my life.
