### Hello world!

This blog is generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) software and the theme is
[Moon](http://taylantatli.me/Moon). It is freely hosted by [Github](https://github.com).
I really appreciate these open source softwares and services.

My available personal information is posted in **About**.
The motivation of writing this blog is sharing some notes about programming or learning seismic theory.
Meanwhile the blog is also used to mark my lifetime.
