## My Atom Configuration


> This folder contains the default and my customized shortcuts with some useful
packages with Atom editor


I have worked with the VIM editor for almost 7 years and I customized it for a
long time with my hobbies. However, my most favorite plug-in, You Complete Me,
strike with my unintentional update. So I decided to change to an alternative
editor, the 21st century editor ATOM, which is provided by the Github.


### How to use this repository


This repository provides my customization with the Atom with my hobbies in the
VIM. The Atom configuration file is under `~/.atom` folder, which is
automatically created during the installation. All the customization files
(snippets,shortcuts,list of packages) can be directly moved to the `~/.atom`
folder.  


### List of packages


The following are packages that I am using with:


+ atom-beautify
+ easy-motion-redux
+ ex-mode
+ git-plus
+ language-latex
+ latex
+ markdown-preview-enhanced
+ minimap
+ platformio-ide-terminal
+ relative-numbers
+ vim-mode-plus
