This static website is generated by the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) 
software, and it is freely hosted by the [Github](https://github.com).  The 
jekyll theme is provided by [Renyuan Zou](https://github.com/renyuanz/leonids). 
I really appreciate these open source software and services.

My available personal information is posted in resume. The motivation 
of writing this blog is taking notes about my interests. Meanwhile the blog is 
also used to mark my life.
